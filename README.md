# FurnitureDelivery

Adds ordering furniture in deliveries.

![listing in deliveries app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k073l/s1-FurnitureDelivery/master/assets/listing.png)

## Installation
1. Install MelonLoader
2. Extract the zip file
3. Place the dll file into the Mods directory for your branch
   - For none/beta use IL2CPP
   - For alternate/alternate beta use Mono
4. Launch the game

**Note:** Might cause issues with other Delivery mods. Make sure you have a backup if you use those.

**Another note:** I don't recommend saving your game with pending deliveries - in transit or arrived. This is especially true for Herbert's and Armory, as their cars are created when the game loads (and their deliveries might disappear on load). Be sure to unload their deliveries before saving.

### Mod compatibility
- [More Guns](https://thunderstore.io/c/schedule-i/p/Universal/MoreGuns/) - Adds AK47 and ammo to Armory delivery service.
- [Toileportation](https://thunderstore.io/c/schedule-i/p/weedeej/Toileportation/) - Adds Golden Toilet to Herbert's Curiosities delivery service.
- [UpgradedTrashCans](https://thunderstore.io/c/schedule-i/p/j0ckinjz/UpgradedTrashCans_Mono/) - Adds Trash Bin and Trash Compactor to Dan's Furniture delivery service.
- [DeliveryApp Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/schedule1/mods/521) - Delivery services added by FurnitureDelivery can be automated using this mod.

All of these mods are optional and not required for the mod to work.

Other tested:
- [UI Dark Mode](https://www.nexusmods.com/schedule1/mods/554) - `System.NullReferenceException` will be thrown when adding delivery shops, but the mod will work fine otherwise.
